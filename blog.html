    <p>🎀 During <strong>free time</strong> I played <strong>jump rope</strong> first 🪢 but then got bored, so I moved to <strong>volleyball</strong> 🏐🎀.</p>
    <p>🎀 The volleyball game turned into <strong>kick tennis</strong> 🎾 so I decided to go play <strong>basketball</strong> 🏀 and shoot hoops instead. It was such a fun day 🎀 and the pizza was soooo good! 🍕💜🎀</p>

    <h2>A Roblox and Leaf-Raking Day 🎮🍃</h2>
    <p>Today started off really chill — I was playing <span class="highlight">Roblox</span> on my iPad and watching TV for most of the morning 📱📺. It was super relaxing!</p>
    <p>Then after lunchtime, things changed... I had to go outside and <span class="highlight">rake up leaves</span> in the backyard for <strong>3 whole hours</strong> 🍂🍁. It felt like it was never-ending but at least the yard looks good now.</p>
    <p>Now I’ve just come inside, feeling tired but happy, and I’m finishing up my <span class="highlight">coding update for today</span>. I’m proud I still got my coding done even after all that raking!</p>
    <p>Hopefully tomorrow will be a bit more relaxing again!</p>

    <p>🎨 After I finished all my work, I got <strong>free time</strong> and I drew a <strong>bird</strong> 🐦 and a <strong>turtle</strong> 🐢 — they turned out so cute!</p>
    <p>📚 After school, I went to the <strong>library</strong> with my dad and borrowed <strong>Pawcasso</strong> 🐕 and <strong>Stuck</strong> 🌳 — both are fun graphic novels!</p>
    <p>🌸 Then we went to another library and got <strong>two free plants</strong> 🌱🌿, and after that we stopped by <strong>Baskin Robbins</strong> 🍨 where I got an ice cream. Yummy treat to end a fun day! 🎀🍡</p>

    <h1>😵 25 July Rash Day</h1>
    <div class="date">📅 25 July</div>
    <p>Today I got the day off school because I had a really bad allergic reaction and a big rash all over 😬. I had a warm shower in the morning hoping it would help, but it just made everything look even redder!</p>
    <p>So we went to the doctor under Stocklands and the doctor said warm showers can actually make rashes worse 😣. After that, we stopped at Aldi for a bit, then went home so I could rest.</p>
    <p>Even though it was the first week back for school sport, I stayed home. At school they decided what to go as for Book Week, and I think the class voted on going as coke bottles 🥤! I’ll have to check on Monday to know for sure.</p>

  <h2>⚽ 28 July 2025 - Soccer Ball Stealers! 😄</h2>
  <p>Today in PE we played a really fun soccer game — but instead of just passing, we had to <strong>steal</strong> soccer balls from each other! 😂</p>
  <p>It was hilarious watching everyone sneak up and try to snatch the ball without getting caught. I ran so fast I nearly flew! 🏃‍♀️💨</p>
  <p>Sometimes I stole it, sometimes I lost it... but it was <em>so much fun</em>! ⚽ Can’t wait to play again!</p>
  <p>Next time I'm going full ninja mode 🥷⚽✨</p>
