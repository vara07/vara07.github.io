    <h2>🎃 27 October 2025 🎃</h2>
    <p>
      Today I went to school and we had <strong>P.E</strong> — we had to dance with all of the <strong>boys 😬</strong>!  
      <br><br>
      When I got home, my <strong>Halloween costume</strong> came today 😃!  
      Me, <strong>Jamie</strong>, and <strong>Elise</strong> are going as <strong>Alvin and the Chipmunks 🐿️</strong>!  
      I’m going as <strong>Simon</strong> (the smart one 🤓), Jamie is <strong>Theodore</strong> (the chubby one 🐻), and Elise is <strong>Alvin</strong> (the awesome one 😎).  
      <br><br>
      I tried on the outfit and it fits <strong>really well</strong>! 🧛‍♀️✨

    <p>
      Today my <strong>auntie</strong> came over to give me a surprise and the surprise was a <strong>Disney Labubu</strong>!  
      I don’t really know what they’re called but we call them Disney Labubus 😆 — she got me a <strong>mystery box</strong> and I got <strong>Pluto</strong>! 🐶💛  
      <br><br>
      Later today I went shopping with my friends <strong>Jamie</strong> and <strong>Elise</strong>! We went to <strong>Kmart</strong>, <strong>Ally</strong>, <strong>Sportsgirl</strong>, <strong>The Body Shop</strong>, <strong>Big W</strong>, <strong>Cotton On</strong>, <strong>Rebel</strong>, <strong>Eat Up</strong> (sushi 🍣), <strong>Boost</strong> (smoothies 🥤), and <strong>Coles</strong>!  
      Jamie even got me a <strong>Mango Magic</strong> smoothie 🍹 — it was sooo yummy! 💕🛍️

      In that lesson, we were learning how to use <strong>Microbit</strong> — there are different lessons to follow and our whole class had to do the <strong>Step Counter</strong> lesson!  
      It showed us how to make the Microbit count steps, and even I did it — and it worked really well! ⚡

    <h2>🎆 Thursday, 16th October 2025 🎆</h2>
    <p>
      Today was my <strong>second day back at school for Term 4</strong> after our <strong>big holiday to Japan</strong> 🇯🇵!  
      I haven’t posted an update in a while because we went to <strong>Disneyland</strong> 🏰, then got on a <strong>cruise ship</strong> 🚢 where I had no internet.  
      After that, we went to <strong>Tokyo Disneyland</strong> 🇯🇵✨!
    </p>

    <p>
      At the Disney Store in Tokyo, I got <strong>5 keychain plushies</strong> 🧸💖 and my auntie bought me a <strong>sleeping mystery box plushie</strong> —  
      I got <strong>Donald Duck</strong> 🦆💙 and I’m so happy!  
    </p>

    <p>
      My cousin got <strong>Scrump</strong> (Lilo’s plushie from Lilo & Stitch) 💚,  
      my other cousin got <strong>Nick Wilde</strong> 🦊 from Zootopia, and her brother got <strong>Piglet</strong> 🐷 from Winnie the Pooh —  
      but they swapped so now her brother has Nick Wilde and she has Piglet! 💕
    </p>

    <p>✨ It was such a magical trip, and I’m still so happy thinking about it! ✨</p>

    <h2>19 August 2025</h2>
    <p>Today is Tuesday and we had a <strong>substitute teacher</strong> because Mr. Foggy was away.  
    Instead, we had <strong>Mrs. Waldron</strong> and we had a really good day. ✨  
    This afternoon, all of <strong>Grade 6 (me!)</strong> had a meeting about  
    <em>graduation photos, attitude, backchat, SWEARING, camp, and mobile phones</em>.  
    After that, it was finally <strong>HOMETIME</strong> 🏡.  
    And tomorrow… it’s <strong>BOOK WEEK</strong>! 📚🎉</p>

    At first I didn’t want to go as a coke bottle (and honestly, I still don’t),

    Me and my sister Zoe bought 2 little $2 gems, and I even found a tiny one on the floor (so lucky!).
