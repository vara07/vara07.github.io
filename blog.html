  <h2 class="update-title">🌧️ 27th of Feb – Rain, Lockers & Couch Mode 🛋️</h2>

  <p class="update-text">
    Today I had <b>English</b> in period 1 📖  
    Then I had <b>Math</b>, which is right next to our lockers 
    (very convenient because I had to grab my math stuff first 😌).

    At lunch we had to eat inside the <b>Hall</b> because it was raining
    really really heavy 🌧️🌦️  

    Period 3 was <b>H.A.S.S.</b> 🌏  
    Then… <b>SNACK BREAK</b> 🤤🥪  

    In period 4 I had <b>Japanese</b> 🇯🇵  

    When the bell went, I went straight to my locker,
    swapped all my books, and texted Mum to say I was on my way
    to the <b>party shop</b> where I get picked up.

    I got driven home 🏠 and now I’m sitting on the couch 🛋️
    writing this blog update.

    After this? I’m going to watch 
    <b>MrBeast inspiring stories</b> on Prime Video 🎬✨

  <h2 class="update-title">🌌 26th of Feb – Low Battery & Science Energy 🧪⚡</h2>

  <p class="update-text">
    Today I woke up <b>super early</b> and got ready for school 🌅  
    Dad dropped me off at about <b>7:15am</b>.

    We have to put our phones away at 8, so I was sitting in the eating area 
    on my phone waiting for my friends... until suddenly ⚠️  
    I got a pop-up saying I only had <b>10% battery</b> left 😭📱  

    So I packed it up and put it in my locker.

    Then out of nowhere I see <b>Mia</b> walking toward me ✨  
    We chatted for a bit until the bell rang.  
    I also saw <b>Amelia</b> at her locker but I was already lining up
    outside the <b>Japanese classroom</b>.

    Period 1: <b>Japanese</b> 🇯🇵  
    Period 2: <b>Religion</b>  
    Then finally <b>Lunch</b> 🥪  

    Period 3: <b>Tute</b>  
    Then snack break 🍎  

    And Period 4 was <b>SCIENCE</b> 🧪🧫🧬  
    We did some very science-y stuff. Very official. Very lab vibes.

    And that was my galactic school day ✨

    Today was <b>the 25th of February</b> ✨  

    In period 1 I had my <b>2nd favourite subject — P.E</b> 🏃‍♀️  
    We went to the oval and played <b>bull rush</b> and another game where
    we had to stay inside a box and rip each other’s tags off our Velcro belts 😭  
    It was actually SO fun.

    Then I had my <b>3rd favourite subject — Maths</b> 📐  
    The best part? My teacher gives us <b>fruit Mentos</b> 🍬  
    Instant motivation unlocked.

    In period 3 we had <b>H.A.S.S</b> 🌏  

    And in period 4 we had my ULTIMATE FAVOURITE 🤩  
    <b>MUSIC!!!</b> 🎶  
    We got to play the <b>electric keyboard</b> ⚡🎹

    Today was <b>the 23rd of February</b> ✨  

    This morning I had <b>English</b>, and after that in period 2 we had 
    <b>Religion</b>. In Religion we got told about an upcoming assessment 
    which was… interesting 👀  

    Then it was finally <b>lunchtime</b> 😋🥪  

    After lunch I had <b>Science</b> but we didn’t do any experiments 
    which was kind of sad because experiments are the best part 🧪  

    Then we had our super short break that we call 
    <b>snack break</b> 🍎  

    After that it was back to classes, and my last class of the day was 
    <b>HASS</b>. All we did in HASS was work on this history thing on a 
    website called <b>Education Perfect</b>.  

    And that was my day 🌇✨

    <p>
      Today my parents didn’t pick me up from school but you know who did???  
      <strong>Elise’s mum</strong> — and <strong>Jamie</strong> came too! 🥳  
      It was <strong>so fun</strong> but we had to pick up <strong>Elise’s brother</strong> also.  
      <br><br>
      When we got to Elise’s house her mum painted our nails 💅 ready for <strong>Halloween 👻🎃</strong>!  
      We’re going as the <strong>Chipmunks 🐿️</strong> and we also played some games at her house.  
      <br><br>
      Then we walked to my house to get my costume and we all got in our outfits!  
      I’m <strong>Simon</strong> (the smart one 🤓), Jamie is <strong>Theodore</strong> (the chubby one 🐻), and Elise is <strong>Alvin</strong> (the awesome one 😎).  
      <br><br>
      We all look <strong>so good</strong> in our costumes — not gonna lie 😝✨

    <p>
      Today was my <strong>second day back at school for Term 4</strong> after our <strong>big holiday to Japan</strong> 🇯🇵!  
      I haven’t posted an update in a while because we went to <strong>Disneyland</strong> 🏰, then got on a <strong>cruise ship</strong> 🚢 where I had no internet.  
      After that, we went to <strong>Tokyo Disneyland</strong> 🇯🇵✨!
    </p>

    <p>
      At the Disney Store in Tokyo, I got <strong>5 keychain plushies</strong> 🧸💖 and my auntie bought me a <strong>sleeping mystery box plushie</strong> —  
      I got <strong>Donald Duck</strong> 🦆💙 and I’m so happy!  
    </p>

    <p>
      My cousin got <strong>Scrump</strong> (Lilo’s plushie from Lilo & Stitch) 💚,  
      my other cousin got <strong>Nick Wilde</strong> 🦊 from Zootopia, and her brother got <strong>Piglet</strong> 🐷 from Winnie the Pooh —  
      but they swapped so now her brother has Nick Wilde and she has Piglet! 💕
    </p>

    <p>✨ It was such a magical trip, and I’m still so happy thinking about it! ✨</p>

      In the morning we had a <strong>Book Week Parade</strong> in the hanger.  
      It was so funny and fun seeing everyone’s costumes!

    <p>Today is Tuesday and we had a <strong>substitute teacher</strong> because Mr. Foggy was away.  
    Instead, we had <strong>Mrs. Waldron</strong> and we had a really good day. ✨
