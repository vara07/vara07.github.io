  <div class="box raindrops">
    <h2>Jumping in the Rain ☔</h2>
    <p>Today we played on the trampoline while it was raining! It was super slippery, and we couldn’t stop laughing. Zoe screamed every time she bounced too high, and Ivy lay down and pretended to be a raindrop. I felt like I was flying every time I jumped!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="box raindrops">
    <h2>Playtime with Boswell 🐶</h2>
    <p>After we finished jumping, our dog Boswell came running outside. His paws splashed in the puddles and he zoomed around the yard like a crazy wet sausage! We tried to dry him with a towel, but he thought it was a game and kept running away. Ivy chased him in circles while Zoe laughed and fell over!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="box raindrops">
    <h2>Lunch & Dessert 🍜🍧</h2>
    <p>For lunch I had my favorite noodles — they were warm and yummy. Then I had a cold ice block for dessert! It was so sweet and refreshing, even though we were already wet from the rain!</p>
  </div>

    <h2>Nana Came Home 🏡💖</h2>
    <p>My nana just arrived home! I gave her a big hug and told her all about my day. I’m so happy she’s back!</p>

    <h2>Cousin’s 10th Birthday Party 🎈</h2>
    <p>Today was my cousin’s 10th birthday party and we celebrated at the bowling alley! First, we played bowling and I even got a strike! 🎳 Everyone was cheering and laughing and having the best time.</p>
    <p>After that, we played laser tag! It was in a dark, glowing maze and I felt like I was in a video game. I ran, hid behind barriers, and tagged as many people as I could. It was so exciting and fun! 🔫🌟</p>

    <h2>Trampoline Time & a Juicy Carrot 🎶🥕</h2>
    <p>Today I jumped on the trampoline while listening to my favourite music. I bounced super high and danced in the air like I was at a concert! 🎵💃🛝</p>
    <p>Then my dad came over and made me eat a raw carrot. At first I didn’t want to, but I tried it... and it actually tasted cold and juicy! 🥕❄️😋</p>

    <h2>Back to School Adventures 🚸</h2>
    <p>Today was my <span class="highlight">first day back at school</span> after the holidays! I was a little nervous at first but also excited to see my friends again.</p>
    <p>We had fun sharing stories about our holidays, met our new teacher, and I even got to sit next to my best friend. The classroom looks really nice and fresh this year! 🌟</p>
    <p>It feels weird waking up early again, but I’m happy to be back learning new things and having fun. Hopefully tomorrow will be just as good, or even better!</p>

  <h2>Learning GitHub 🚀</h2>
  <p>Today I learned how to use <span>GitHub</span> and it was actually super cool! I figured out how to make a website, upload it, and now everyone can see my blog online! 🌐</p>
  <p>At first it felt like I was learning hacker code 👾 but after a while I got the hang of it. I even made my own <span>repository</span> and uploaded my files!</p>
  <p>I can’t wait to make more updates and cool websites all by myself. I’m a coding pro now! 👩‍💻✨</p>
