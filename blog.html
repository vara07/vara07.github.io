    <p>Today was Friday and that means <strong>SPORT</strong>! I went to netball and we WON <strong>2-0</strong> 🏆. I think we could’ve played even better, but honestly, we did our best and that’s what counts!</p>

    <p>Today we had music and health. In music, we listened to a video on YouTube about music from around the world. In health… honestly, I have no idea what we were doing because it didn’t make any sense to me 😂.</p>
    <p>This afternoon we had religion, and since I go to non-religion, I worked on my paragraph 2 for the John Marsden comparison.</p>

    Today in Science we had a delicious experiment! We got to taste 
    <strong>Turkish bread</strong>,the turkish bread tasted like dust, <strong>white bread</strong>,that just tasted like regular bread, and a <strong>wrap slice</strong>the wrap tasted like regular wrap.  
    Definitely my favourite science lesson so far!

    <p>Today I got the day off school because I had a really bad allergic reaction and a big rash all over 😬. I had a warm shower in the morning hoping it would help, but it just made everything look even redder!</p>
    <p>So we went to the doctor under Stocklands and the doctor said warm showers can actually make rashes worse 😣. After that, we stopped at Aldi for a bit, then went home so I could rest.</p>
    <p>Even though it was the first week back for school sport, I stayed home. At school they decided what to go as for Book Week, and I think the class voted on going as coke bottles 🥤! I’ll have to check on Monday to know for sure.</p>
